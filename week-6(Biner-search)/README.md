## BST(Binary Search Tree)

- small to large number.
- for every node ``left`` small to `right` large node.
- not insert the duplicate value in BST.
- complexity for search `O(h)` in BST ; `h= height`.
- when search in array it should must `sorted` but not need in BST.
- complexity for search in `O(h) | NlogN | N^2`
- possible Array `to` BST.
